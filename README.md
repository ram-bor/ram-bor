### Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Roberto Ramos!

I am a Software Engineer ready to complete your full-stack needs. I believe in working with people, not users, by developing rapport and inclusivity through communication and technology. I'm able to adapt and cater my skills and perspective to achieve project needs with respect to functionality, performance and extensibility. The passion I carry for designing, developing and deploying applications can be seen in my work and can-do attitude.

Take a look at my repositories for projects I am currently working on. More to come soon!
